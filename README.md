# Deep Learning Algorithm for Exoplanet Classification
## AI Spring 2024

Submitted by: **Brian Johnson**

## Abstract
With the discoveries of exoplanets increasing, creating
techniques used to classify them are essential for efficiency.
While there are ways to classify exoplanets, they often suffer
from limitations. Therefore, this paper reflects a deep
learning-based algorithm trained on a dataset consisting of
information and observations from known exoplanetary
systems for identifying planets outside of our solar system
while also distinguishing these exoplanets from fake
positives. The methodology involved training a machine
learning model by using linear regression with various data
about exoplanetary systems such as light curves. Although
expectations were high, results demonstrate the lack of
effectiveness of this approach, having an accuracy of less
than 20%.
